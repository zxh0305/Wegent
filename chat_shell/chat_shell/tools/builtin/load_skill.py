"""Load skill tool for on-demand skill prompt expansion.

This tool implements session-level skill expansion caching:
- Within a single user-AI conversation turn, a skill only needs to be expanded once
- Subsequent calls to the same skill in the same turn return a confirmation message
- When the AI finishes responding to the user, the expansion state is cleared
- The next user message starts a fresh conversation turn

In HTTP mode, skill prompts are obtained from the skill_configs passed via ChatRequest.
